# The Base's config is initialized with default values, one of which is

# ("/etc/dnf/dnf.conf"). If the file does not exist the distribution config file
# is loaded. Function also loads configuration files from distribution and
# user ("/etc/dnf/libdnf5.conf.d") drop-in directories.
# Optionally set a custom value to "config_file_path" before calling this method
# to load configuration from a another configuration file.

# Its value can be printed by get_value method

#
# There are plans in the future to support the methods get() or get_priority()

# Optionally set cachedir.
#
# By default, system cachedir or user cachedir is used, but we can set it to a
# different location. This is useful for tests.
