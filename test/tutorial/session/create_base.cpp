// Installroot is set to '/' when we're working with the system, but we can set

//
// The Base's config is initialized with default values, one of which is
// "config_file_path". This contains the default path to the config file
// ("/etc/dnf/dnf.conf"). If the file does not exist the distribution config file
// is loaded. Function also loads configuration files from distribution and
// user ("/etc/dnf/libdnf5.conf.d") drop-in directories.
// Optionally set a custom value to "config_file_path" before calling this method
// to load configuration from a another configuration file.
base.load_config();

// Load vars and do other initialization (of libsolv pool, etc.) based on the
// configuration.  Locks the installroot and varsdir configuration values so
// that they can't be changed.
