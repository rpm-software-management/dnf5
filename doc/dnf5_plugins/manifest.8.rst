Synopsis
========

``dnf5 manifest new [options] [<package-spec-NPFB>...]``

``dnf5 manifest download [options]``

``dnf5 manifest install [options]``


Description
===========

For working with RPM package manifest files using the `libpkgmanifest <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/libpkgmanifest>`_ library.

:ref:`skip_if_unavailable <_skip_if_unavailable_options-label>` and `skip_broken <_skip_broken_options-label` will be set to ``false`` for all operations.


``new``
    Create a manifest file based on a list of packages or the installed
    packages on the system.

    If given a list of packages, all packages and their dependencies will be
    resolved and pinned in the manifest file.

    If a list of packages is not given, all installed packages on the system
    will be pinned in the manifest file.

``resolve``
    Create a manifest file from a provided input file.

    Resolves the list of packages specified in the input file and pins all
    packages and their dependencies in the manifest file.

``download``
    Download all packages specified in the manifest file to disk.

    By default, packages are downloaded to a subfolder named after the
    manifest file. You can also use the ``--destdir`` option to
    specify a custom directory for the downloaded packages.

    The manifest file may contain packages for multiple base architectures.
    By default, only packages corresponding to the current system architecture
    are downloaded. To download packages for specific architectures, use the
    ``--arch`` option.

``install``
    Install all packages specified in the manifest file.

---------
Arguments
---------

``<package-spec-NPFB>``
    Specification for including a package in the manifest file.
    Local RPMs are not supported.
    For more information, refer to :ref:`Specifying Packages <specifying_packages-label>`.

-------
Options
-------

``--input``
    Specify a custom path for the prototype input file.
    By default, ``rpms.in.yaml`` is used.

``--manifest``
    Specify a custom path for the manifest file.
    By default, ``packages.manifest.yaml`` is used.

``--srpm``
    Include source packages in consideration.
    Not supported for the ``install`` command.

``--use-system``
    Consider currently installed system packages for dependency resolution
    and exclude them from the resulting manifest file.

``--arch``
    Specify a comma-separated list of architectures to work with.
    By default, only packages corresponding to the current system architecture are processed.

``--per-arch``
    Create a separate manifest file for each requested base architecture.
    By default, a single manifest file is created for all architectures.

--------
Examples
--------

``dnf manifest resolve``
    Resolve the ``rpms.in.yaml`` prototype input file in the current directory
    and create the resulting manifest file at the default location:
    ``packages.manifest.yaml``.

``dnf manifest new``
    Create a new manifest file from the system's installed packages. The new
    manifest file will be created at the default location:
    ``packages.manifest.yaml``.

``dnf manifest new alsa-lib alsa-tools``
    Create a new manifest file containing the ``alsa-lib`` and ``alsa-tools`` packages along
    with all their dependencies.

``dnf manifest new wget --use-system``
    Create a new manifest file including the ``wget`` package and all its uninstalled dependencies.

``dnf manifest download --manifest /home/user/Downloads/manifest.yaml --srpm``
    Download all packages, including source packages, specified in the given manifest file.

``dnf manifest install -y``
    Install all packages specified in the manifest file located in the current directory
    under the default file name, automatically answering "yes" to all prompts during the
    transaction resolution.
