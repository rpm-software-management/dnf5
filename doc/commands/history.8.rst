 History Command

Synopsis
========

``dnf5 history <subcommand> [options] [<transaction-spec>]``


Description
===========

The ``history`` command in ``DNF5`` allows the user to view what has happened in past transactions
and offers several operations on these transactions, like undoing and redoing them. In order to
use the transactions in these commands, it is assumed that they were committed while using the
``history_record`` configuration option.

For more information about ``<transaction-spec>`` see
:manpage:`dnf5-specs(7)`, :ref:`Patterns specification <transaction_spec-label>`.

Subcommands
===========

``list``
    | List info about recorded transactions in the system.
    | If no ``<transaction-spec>`` is specified it uses all transactions.

``info``
    | Print details about specific transactions.
    | If no ``<transaction-spec>`` is specified it uses the last transaction.

``undo``
    | Revert all actions from the specified transaction.
    | Exactly one transaction must be specified by ``<transaction-spec>``.

``redo``
    | Repeat the specified transaction.
    | Automatically uses ``--ignore-extras`` and ``--ignore-installed``.
    | Unlike the rest of history commands it overrides reasons for transaction packages that are already installed.
    | This command is useful to finish interrupted transactons.
    | Exactly one transaction must be specified by ``<transaction-spec>``.

``rollback``
    | Undo all transactions performed after the specified transaction.
    | Exactly one transaction must be specified by ``<transaction-spec>``.

``store``
    | Store the transaction into a directory.
    | If no ``<transaction-spec>`` is specified it uses the last transaction.


Options for ``list`` and ``info``
=================================

``--reverse``
    | Reverse the order of transactions in the output.

``--contains-pkgs=PACKAGE_NAME,...``
    | Show only transactions containing packages with specified names.
    | This is a list option. Globs are supported.

``--json``
    | Request JSON output format for machine-readable results.
    | Available for ``list`` and ``info`` subcommands only.


Options for ``undo``, ``rollback`` and ``redo``
===============================================

``--skip-unavailable``
    | Allow skipping packages actions that are not possible perform.

.. include:: ../_shared/options/transaction.rst


Options for ``undo`` and ``rollback``
=====================================

``--ignore-extras``
    | Don't consider extra packages pulled into the transaction as errors.
    | They will still be reported as warnings.

``--ignore-installed``
    | Don't consider mismatches between installed and stored transaction packages as errors.
    | They will still be reported as warnings.
    | Using this option can result in an empty transaction.
    | For install actions skip already installed packages.
    | For upgrade actions skip groups or environments that are not installed.
    | For remove actions skip not installed packages/groups/environments.


Examples
========

``dnf5 history list``
    | List all transactions, where the most recent transaction is printed first.

``dnf5 history info 4``
    | Show detailed info about the fourth transaction.

``dnf5 history info last``
    | Show detailed info about the last transaction.

``dnf5 history info last-1``
    | Show detailed info about the second to last transaction.

``dnf5 history list 4..8``
    | List transactions with id in 4 to 8 range.

``dnf5 history undo last``
    | Undo the last transaction.

``dnf5 history undo 4 --ignore-extras``
    | Undo the fourth transaction ignoring extra packages pulled into the reverting transaction.

``dnf5 history list --json``
    | List all transactions in JSON format for programmatic processing.

``dnf5 history info last --json``
    | Show detailed info about the last transaction in JSON format with complete package details.
