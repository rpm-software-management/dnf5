 Install Command
################

Synopsis
========

``dnf5 install [options] <package-spec>|@<group-spec>|@<environment-spec>...``


Description
===========

The ``install`` command in ``DNF5`` is used for installing packages, groups or environments.

When installing packages defined in ``package-spec`` arguments, ``DNF5`` ensures that the packages
and their dependencies are installed on the system.
If the specified packages are already installed, DNF5 does not check their dependencies again and
simply verifies that the packages themselves are present.

When installing groups defined in ``group-spec`` arguments, ``DNF5`` ensures that the groups and
their packages are installed on the system. Installs only group packages matching configured package
type. See :manpage:`dnf5-conf(5)`, :ref:`group_package_types <group_package_types_options-label>`.

When installing environments defined in ``environment-spec`` arguments, ``DNF5`` ensures that the
environments and their groups are installed on the system.
