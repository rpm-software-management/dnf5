 Upgrade Command
################

Synopsis
========

``dnf5 upgrade [options] [<package-spec>|@<group-spec>|@<environment-spec>...]``


Description
===========

The ``upgrade`` command in ``DNF5`` is used for upgrading installed packages, groups or
environments to newer available version.

Since groups and environments are not versioned the upgrade basically means a synchronization
with the currently available definition. In addition group upgrade also upgrades all packages
the group contains and environment upgrade also upgrades all groups the environment contains.



Options
=======

``--minimal``
    | Upgrade packages only to the lowest available versions that fix advisories of type bugfix, enhancement, security, or
    | newpackage. In case that any option limiting advisories is used it upgrades packages only to the lowest versions
    | that fix advisories matching selected advisory properties

``--allowerasing``
    | Allow removing of installed packages to resolve any potential dependency problems.

``--skip-unavailable``
    | Allow skipping packages that are not possible to upgrade. All remaining packages will be upgraded.

``--allow-downgrade``
    | Enable downgrade of dependencies when resolving the requested operation.

``--no-allow-downgrade``
    | Disable downgrade of dependencies when resolving the requested operation.

``--destdir=<path>``
    | Set directory used for downloading packages to. Default location is to the current working directory.
    | Automatically sets the ``downloadonly`` option.

.. include:: ../_shared/options/from-repo.rst

    | Only download packages for transaction.

``--offline``
    | Store the transaction to be performed offline. See :manpage:`dnf5-offline(8)`, :ref:`Offline command <offline_command_ref-label>`.
