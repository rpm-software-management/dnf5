 Makecache Command

Synopsis
========

``dnf5 makecache [global options]``


Description
===========

The ``makecache`` command in ``DNF5`` is used for creating and downloading metadata
for enabled repositories.

It tries to avoid downloading whenever possible, e.g. when the local metadata hasn't
expired yet or when the metadata timestamp hasn't changed.
