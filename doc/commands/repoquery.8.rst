===========

The ``repoquery`` command in ``DNF5`` is used for querying packages by matching
various input criteria from the user. Arguments defined in ``spec`` list are used
as ``<package-file-spec>``.


Options
=======

``--advisories=ADVISORY_NAME,...``
    | Limit to packages in advisories with specified name.

    | Limit to packages of these architectures.
    | This is a list option.

``--available``
    | Query available packages.
    | This is the default behavior.
    | Can be combined with ``--installed`` to query both installed and available packages.

``--disable-modular-filtering``
    | Include packages of inactive module streams.

    | Limit to installed duplicate packages (i.e. more package versions for  the  same  name and architecture).
    | Installonly packages are excluded from this set.

``--enhancement``
    | Limit to packages in enhancement advisories.

``--exactdeps``
    | Limit to packages that require <capability> specified by --whatrequires or --whatdepends.
    | This option is stackable with --whatrequires or --whatdepends only.

``--extras``
    | Limit to installed packages that are not present in any available repository.

``--file=FILE,...``
    | Limit to packages that own these files.
    | This is a list option.

``--installed``
    | Query installed packages.
    | Can be combined with ``--available`` to query both installed and available packages.

``--installonly``
    | Limit to installed installonly packages.

``--latest-limit=N``
    | Limit to N latest packages for a given name.arch (or all except N latest if N is negative).

``--leaves``
    | Limit to groups of installed packages not required by other installed packages.

``--newpackage``
    | Limit to packages in newpackage advisories.

``--providers-of=PACKAGE_ATTRIBUTE``

    | Supports: conflicts, depends, enhances, obsoletes, provides, recommends, requires, requires_pre, suggests, supplements.

``--recent``
    | Limit to only recently changed packages.

``--recursive``
    | This option is stackable with --whatrequires or --providers-of=requires only.
    | When used with --whatrequires: it extends the output with packages that require anything provided by outputted packages.
    | When used with --providers-of=requires: it extends the output with packages that provide anything required by outputted packages.

    | The added packages are limited by ``--available``, ``--installed`` and ``--arch`` options.

``--security``
    | Limit to packages in security advisories.

``--srpm``
    | After filtering is finished use packages' corresponding source RPMs for output.
    | Enables source repositories.

``--unneeded``

    | This switch lists packages that are going to be removed after executing the `autoremove` command.

``--upgrades``
    | Limit to available packages that provide an upgrade for some already installed package.

``--userinstalled``
    | Limit to packages that are not installed as dependencies or weak dependencies.
