####################

Synopsis
========

``dnf5 distro-sync [options] [<package-spec>...]``


Description
===========

The ``distro-sync`` command in ``DNF5`` serves to synchronize the installed packages
with their latest available version from any enabled repository. It upgrades, downgrades
or keeps packages as needed.

Optional ``package-spec`` arguments could be passed to select only specific packages to be synced.


Options
=======

``--allowerasing``
    | Allow erasing of installed packages to resolve any potential dependency problems.

``--skip-broken``
    | Resolve any dependency problems by removing packages that are causing problems from the transaction.

``--skip-unavailable``
    | Allow skipping packages that are not possible to synchronize. All remaining packages will be synchronized.

``--downloadonly``
    | Download the resolved package set without executing an RPM transaction.

``--offline``
    | Store the transaction to be performed offline. See :manpage:`dnf5-offline(8)`, :ref:`Offline command <offline_command_ref-label>`.


Examples
========

``dnf5 distro-sync``
    | Sync the whole system to the latest available version of packages.

``dnf5 distro-sync vim``
    | Sync the ``vim`` package to the latest available version.
