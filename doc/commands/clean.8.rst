 Clean Command
##############

Synopsis
========

``dnf5 clean [options] <cache_types>...``


Description
===========

The ``clean`` command in ``DNF5`` is used to delete temporarily kept repository metadata 
or marking the cache expired.

Arguments in ``cache_types`` specify which types of the cached data to cleanup:

`all`
    | Delete all temporary repository data from the system.

`packages`
    | Delete any cached packages.

`metadata`
    | Delete repository metadata.
    | This will delete the files which ``DNF5`` uses to determine the remote availability of packages. 
    | Using this option will make ``DNF5`` download all the metadata the next time it is run.

`dbcache`
    | Delete cache files generated from the repository metadata. 
    | This forces ``DNF5`` to regenerate the cache files the next time it is run.

`expire-cache`
    | Mark the repository metadata expired. 
    | This forces ``DNF5`` to check the validity of the cache the next time it is run.


Examples
========

``dnf5 clean all``
    | Cleanup all repository cached data.

``dnf5 clean packages dbcache``
    | Cleanup all cached packages and dbcache metadata.
