 Autoremove Command
###################

Synopsis
========

``dnf5 autoremove``


Description
===========

The ``autoremove`` command in ``DNF5`` is used for removing unneeded packages
from the system.

Unneeded packages are all "leaf" packages that were originally installed as
dependencies of user-installed packages, but which are no longer required by
any such package.

Installonly packages (e.g. kernels) are never automatically removed by this
command even if they were installed as dependencies.
