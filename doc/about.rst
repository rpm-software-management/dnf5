About
=====

DNF5 is a command-line package manager that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs in a consistent manner.
It supports RPM packages, modulemd modules, and comps groups & environments.

As part of the DNF5 stack, libdnf is the package management library.
It was originally written to support the `DNF <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf/>`_,
package manager and grew up into a versatile library.
Now we can use it for building custom tools that load repositories,
query packages, resolve dependencies and install packages.

It is powered with `libsolv <https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/>`_,
wrapping it with an easy to use programming interface.

DNF5 supports working with the following artifacts:

 * RPM repositories (repomd)
 * RPM packages
 * Comps groups
 * Comps environments
 * Advisories (updateinfo, errata)
 * Modules (modulemd)

DNF5 is written in C++ and it can interface with several programming languages:

 * C++ - fully supported
 * Python 3 - fully supported
 * Perl 5 - best effort
 * Ruby - best effort
 * Go - doesn't work, looking for contributors
 * C - not implemented, doesn't seem to be a priority for any of our existing API users
