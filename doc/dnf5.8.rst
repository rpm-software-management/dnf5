Options
=======

Following options are applicable in the general context for any ``dnf5`` command:

``--assumeno``
    | Automatically answer no for all questions.

.. _best_option_ref-label:

``--best``
    | Try the best available package versions in transactions.

    Specifically during dnf upgrade, which by default skips over updates that can not be
    installed for dependency reasons, the switch forces ``DNF5`` to only consider the latest
    packages. When running into packages with broken dependencies, ``DNF5`` will fail giving
    the reason why the latest version can not be installed.

    Note that the use of the newest available version is only guaranteed for the packages
    directly requested (e.g. as a command line arguments), and the solver may use older
    versions of dependencies to meet their requirements.

``-C, --cacheonly``
    | Use only cached data for working with packages and repository metadata.
    | Cache won't be updated, even if it is expired.

``--comment=COMMENT``
    | Add a comment to the transaction history.

.. _config_option_ref-label:

``--config=CONFIG_FILE_PATH``
    | Define configuration file location.

``--debugsolver``
    | Dump additional data from solver for debugging purposes.
    | Data are saved in ``./debugdata``.

``--disable-plugin=PLUGIN_NAME,...``
    | Disable specified libdnf5 library plugins for the purpose of the current ``DNF5`` command.
    | This is a list option which can be specified multiple times.
    | Accepted values are names, or a glob of names.

``--disable-repo=REPO_ID,...``
    | Temporarily disable active repositories for the purpose of the current ``DNF5`` command.
    | This is a list option which can be specified multiple times.
    | Accepted values are ids, or a glob of ids.

``--dump-main-config``
    | Print main configuration values to stdout.

``--dump-repo-config=REPO_ID,...``
    | Print repository configuration values to stdout.
    | This is a list option which can be specified multiple times.
    | Accepted values are ids, or a glob of ids.

``--dump-variables``
    | Print variable values to stdout.

``--enable-plugin=PLUGIN_NAME,...``
    | Enable specified libdnf5 library plugins for the purpose of the current ``DNF5`` command.
    | This is a list option which can be specified multiple times.
    | Accepted values are names, or a glob of names.

``--enable-repo=REPO_ID,...``
    | Temporarily enable additional repositories for the purpose of the current ``DNF5`` command.
    | This is a list option which can be specified multiple times.
    | Accepted values are ids, or a glob of ids.

``--forcearch=ARCH``
    | Force the use of a specific architecture.
    | :ref:`See <forcearch_misc_ref-label>` :manpage:`dnf5-forcearch(7)` for more info.

.. _help_option_ref-label:

``-h, --help``
    | Show the help.

``--installroot=ABSOLUTE_PATH``
    | Setup installroot path.
    | Absolute path is required.
    | :ref:`See <installroot_misc_ref-label>` :manpage:`dnf5-installroot(7)` for more info.

.. _no_best_option_ref-label:

``--no-best``
    | Do not limit the transaction to the best candidates only.

``--no-docs``
    | Do not install any files that are marked as a documentation (which includes man pages and texinfo documents).
    | It sets the ``RPMTRANS_FLAG_NODOCS`` flag.

``--no-gpgchecks``
    | Skip checking GPG signatures on packages (if ``RPM`` policy allows that).

``--no-plugins``
    | Disable all libdnf5 plugins.

``-q, --quiet``
    In combination with a non-interactive command, shows just the relevant content.
    Suppresses messages notifying about the current state or actions of ``DNF5``.

``--refresh``
    | Force refreshing metadata before running the command.

``--repo=REPO_ID,...``
    | Enable just specified repositories.
    | This is a list option which can be specified multiple times.
    | Accepted values are ids, or a glob of ids.

``--repofrompath=REPO_ID,REPO_PATH``
    Specify a repository to add to the repositories only for this run. Can be used multiple times.

    The new repository id is specified by ``REPO_ID`` and its baseurl by ``REPO_PATH``. Variables in both values are substituted before creating the repo.

    The configuration of the new repository can be adjusted using options ``--setopt=REPO_ID.option=value``.

    If you want only packages from this repository to be available, combine this option with ``--repo=REPO_ID`` switch.

``--releasever=RELEASEVER``
    | Override the value of the distribution release in configuration files.
    | This can affect cache paths, values in configuration files and mirrorlist URLs.

``--setopt=[REPO_ID.]OPTION=VALUE``
    | Override a configuration option from the configuration file.
    | The ``REPO_ID`` parameter is used to override options for repositories.

    Values for the options like ``excludepkgs``, ``includepkgs``, ``installonlypkgs`` and ``tsflags``
    are appended to the original value, they do not override it. However, specifying an empty
    value (e.g. ``--setopt=tsflags=``) will clear the option.

``--setvar=VAR_NAME=VALUE``
    | Override a ``DNF5`` variable value, like ``arch``, ``releasever``, etc.

``--show-new-leaves``
    | Show newly installed leaf packages and packages that became leaves after a transaction.

.. _use_host_config_option_ref-label:

``--use-host-config``
    | Use configuration files and variable definitions from the host system rather than the installroot.
    | :ref:`See <installroot_misc_ref-label>` :manpage:`dnf5-installroot(7)` for more info.

.. _version_option_ref-label:

``--version``
    | Display the version of the dnf5 application and libdnf5 library, along with successfully loaded plugins and their versions, and then exit.

``-y, --assumeyes``
    | Automatically answer yes for all questions.

``-x PACKAGE-SPEC,..., --exclude=PACKAGE-SPEC,...``
    | Exclude packages specified in ``PACKAGE-SPEC`` arguments from the transaction.
    | This is a list option.


Metadata Synchronization
========================

Correct operation of ``DNF5`` depends on having an access to up-to-date data from the all enabled
repositories, but contacting remote mirrors on every operation considerably slows it down and costs
bandwidth for both the client and the repository provider. The ``metadata_expire`` repository configuration
option is used by ``DNF5`` to determine whether a particular local copy of repository data is due
to be re-synced. It is crucial that the repository providers set the option well, namely to a value
where it is guaranteed that if particular metadata was available in time ``T`` on the server,
then all packages it references will still be available for download from the server
in time ``T + metadata_expire``.

To further reduce the bandwidth load, some of the commands where having up-to-date metadata
is not critical (e.g. the ``group list`` command) do not look at whether a repository is expired
and whenever any version of it is locally available to the user's account, it will be used.

:ref:`Refer to the <caching_misc_ref-label>` :manpage:`dnf5-caching(7)` for more info regarding
metadata and packages caching.


Configuration Files Replacement Policy
======================================

The updated packages could replace the old modified configuration files with the new ones or keep
the older files. Neither of the files are actually replaced. To the conflicting ones ``RPM``
gives additional suffix to the origin name. Which file should maintain the true name after
transaction is not controlled by package manager, but is specified by each package itself,
following packaging guideline.


Exit Codes
==========

The ``dnf5`` command in general exits with the following return values:

`0`
    | Operation was successful.

`1`
    | An error occurred during processing of the command.

`2`
    | An error occurred during parsing the arguments.

Other exit codes could be returned by the specific command itself, see its documentation for more info.
