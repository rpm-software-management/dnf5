Tutorial: API changes between DNF and DNF5
==========================================

The following sections describe the most common use cases and point out the main differences. DNF4 uses the libdnf library written in C++, but a lot of functionality exists only in Python, so, the examples cover only the Python API for DNF4.

The section :ref:`other_api_changes_ref-label` covers more detailed changes.
