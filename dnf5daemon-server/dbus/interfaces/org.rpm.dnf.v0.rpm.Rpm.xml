        list:
        @options: an array of key/value pairs
        @packages: array of returned packages with requested attributes

        Get list of packages that match to given filters.
        Since the method returns packages directly in the D-Bus method reply
        message, which has a limited size, there is a possibility that the
        requested package set size would exceed this limit. If you request a
        large number of packages and/or a great number of package attributes,
        please consider using the list_fd() method.

        Following options and filters are supported:

            - package_attrs: list of strings
                list of package attributes that are returned. Supported attributes are name, epoch, version, release, arch, repo_id, from_repo_id, is_installed, install_size, download_size, sourcerpm, summary, url, license, description, files, changelogs, provides, requires, requires_pre, conflicts, obsoletes, recommends, suggests, enhances, supplements, evr, nevra, full_nevra, reason, vendor, group.
            - with_nevra: bool (default true)
                match patterns against available packages NEVRAs
            - with_provides: bool (default true)
                match patterns against available packages provides
            - with_filenames: bool (default true)
                match patterns against names of the files in available packages
            - with_binaries: bool (default true)
                match patterns against names of the binaries in `/usr/(s)bin` in available packages
            - with_src: bool (default true)
                include source rpms into the results
            - icase: bool (default true)
                ignore case while matching patterns

            - patterns: list of strings
                any package matching to any of patterns is returned
            - scope: string (default "all")
                limit packages to one of "all", "installed", "available", "upgrades", "upgradable"
            - arch: list of strings
                limit the resulting set only to packages of given architectures
            - repo: list of strings
                limit the resulting set only to packages from given repositories
            - latest-limit: int

            - whatdepends: list of strings

            - whatrequires: list of strings
                limit the resulting set only to packages that require any of given capabilities
            - whatrecommends: list of strings
                limit the resulting set only to packages that recommend any of given capabilities
            - whatenhances: list of strings
                limit the resulting set only to packages that enhance any of given capabilities
            - whatsuggests: list of strings
                limit the resulting set only to packages that suggest any of given capabilities
            - whatsupplements: list of strings
                limit the resulting set only to packages that supplement any of given capabilities
            - whatobsoletes: list of strings

        Retrieve a list of packages that match the provided filters.
        Packages are transmitted as a stream of JSON objects, with each JSON object representing one package as a dictionary. This stream is then written into the given file_descriptor.
        Unlike the list() method, this approach does not encounter issues with large output data.
        The server has a 30-second timeout during which it waits for the client to read data from the pipe if the pipe is full.
