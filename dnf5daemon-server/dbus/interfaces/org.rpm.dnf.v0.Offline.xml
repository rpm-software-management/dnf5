        cancel_with_options:
        @options: an array of key/value pairs to modify the call behavior
        @success: boolean, returns `false` if there was an error during the transaction cancellation, or if the offline transaction was initiated by another tool than dnf5. Returns `true` if the offline transaction was successfully cancelled or if no offline transaction was configured.
        @error_msg: string, contains error encountered while cancelling the transaction

        Cancel the dnf5 offline transaction configured for the next reboot. Offline updates scheduled by another tool are not cancelled.

        Following @options are supported:
            - interactive: boolean, default true
                Set to "true", when the operation is done by a user, thus user interaction like password prompts can be done.

        Unknown options are ignored.

        Cancel the dnf5 offline transaction configured for the next reboot. Offline updates scheduled by another tool are not cancelled.
