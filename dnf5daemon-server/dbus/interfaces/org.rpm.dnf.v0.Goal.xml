        resolve:
        @options: an array of key/value pairs to modify dependency resolving
        @transaction_items: array of (object_type, action, reason, {transaction_item_attributes}, {object}) tuples. object_type is one of libdnf5::transaction::TransactionItemType, action is one of libdnf5::transaction::TransactionItemAction, reason is one of libdnf5::transaction::TransactionItemReason enums. Each of these enums are represented as strings using corresponding libdnf5::transaction::\*_to_string() methods. transaction_item_attributes is a map {attribute: value}. Currently "reason_change_group_id" attribute is used for target group id in case the action is ReasonChange and the reason Group, and "replaces" containing a vector of packages ids being replaced by this item. Finally the object is a map {attribute: value} and represents (according to object_type) package, group, environment, or module. These package attributes are returned: "name", "epoch", "version", "release", "arch", "repo_id", "from_repo_id", "package_size", "install_size", "evr", and "reason". For groups the object contains "groupid" and "name" attributes.
        @result: problems detected during transaction resolving. Possible values are 0 - no problem, 1 - no problem, but some info / warnings are present or 2 - resolving failed.

        Resolve the transaction.

        Following @options are supported:
            - allow_erasing: boolean, default false
                Whether removal of installed package is allowed to resolve the transaction.

        Unknown options are ignored.

        Following @options are supported:
            - comment: string
                Adds a comment to a transaction.
            - offline: boolean, default false

                Set to "true", when the operation is done by a user, thus user interaction like password prompts can be done.
