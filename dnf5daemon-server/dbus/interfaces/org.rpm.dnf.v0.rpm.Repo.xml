        list:
        @options: an array of key/value pairs
        @repositories: array of returned repositories with requested attributes

        Get list of repositories that match to given filters.

        Following options are supported:

            - patterns: list of strings
                any repository with id matching to any of patterns is returned
            - repo_attrs: list of strings
                list of repository attributes that are returned
            - enable_disable: string (default "enabled")
                When set to "enabled" or "disabled", only enabled / disabled repositories are listed. Any other value means all repositories are returned.

        Unknown options are ignored.
